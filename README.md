## Swipe To Like

SwipeToLike its a very simple project built with python flask and react.js.
It lets you filter a database of pictures on a very basic condintion, like? or not?
For the app illustration I used a json file with 10 cute dogs pictures (which I like all of them. Yeah... it wasn't an easy task to test what happen if i swipe left, but... this is part of the show businesses, am I right?). 

Hope you get some inspiration from it.
